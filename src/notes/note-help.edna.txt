# Why Edna?

## Notes and blocks

In Edna a note is divided into blocks. Each block has a type: markdown, plain text, math block, JavaScript code, Go code etc.

Use:

- `Mod + L` to assign a type for current block
- `Mod + B` to navigate between blocks
- `Mod + A` and `Delete` to delete block (select block text and delete)

Use [keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts) to create blocks, move between blocks.

Navigating between blocks with `Mod + B`:

![Navigate between blocks](/help-blocks.png)

Changing block language with `Mod + L`:

![Change block language](/help-change-block-languge.png)

## No installation required

Edna is a web-based application but can store notes on disk, like a desktop app (when using Chrome or Edge).

You can use it offline (without network connection) and for desktop-like experince you can install a desktop shortcut.

## Miminalist UI, lots of functionality

UI is optimized for writing. Editor uses most of the space.

To acess more functionality:

- `Mod + Shift + K` for command palette
- use [keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts)
- context menu (right-click)
- top navigation bar
- status bar

Command palette with `Mod + Shift + K`:

![Command Palette](/help-command-palette.png)

## Speed

[Edna](https://edna.arslexis.io) is optimized for speed of writing, creating new notes, switching between notes.

Like in Notational Velocity, you can switch between notes, create and delete notes in the same note switcher UI.

Press `Mod + K` for note switcher and:

- switch between notes
- create new note
- delete a note
- assign a quick access `Alt + <n>` shortcut

Note switcher with `Mod + K`:

![Note switcher](/help-note-selector.png)

## Multiple tabs

We support multiple tabs:

![Tabs](/help-multiple-tabs.png)

To open a note in a new tab, press `Mod` when opening a note.

## Minimize top navigation bar

You can minimize / maxmize top navigation bar by pressing an icon in top right corner:

![Minimize navigation bar](/help-minimize-nav-bar.png)

When minimized, navigation bar is hidden by default and only shows when you move mouse or hover it over the bar.

It also uses only as much space as needed for tabs and UI elements, not the whole width of window.

The intent is to maximize amount of space dedicated to the editor.

## Context menu

Press right mouse button for context menu.

Context menu with mouse right click:

![Context menu](/help-context-menu.png)

For native context menu do `Mod + right-click`. This is useful when spell checking to correct mis-spellings.

Alternatively mouse over menu icon in top right corner.

![Context menu](/help-context-menu-2.png)

## Quick access shortcut

You can assign `Alt + 1` to `Alt + 9` for quickly accessing notes:

- `Mod + K` for note selector dialog
- select a note in the list
- press `Alt + 1` to `Alt + 9` to assign it as quick access shortcut

Default shortcuts are:

- `Alt + 1` : scratch note
- `Alt + 2` : daily journal
- `Alt + 3` : inbox

Notes with quick access shortcut are shown at the top of note selector (`Mod + K`) and quick access UI (`Mod + H`)

![Quick access shortcuts](/help-qas.png)

## Quick access UI for starred, recent notes

Use `Mod + H`:

![History of opened files](/help-history.png)

Alternatively mouse over ⏷ in top navigation bar:

![History of opened files](/help-history-2.png)

Drop-down list has:
- notes that have quick access shortcut
- starred notes
- recently opened notes

To open last note: `Mod + H`, `Enter`.

When triggering the list with `Mod + H`, last 10 recently opened notes get a shortcut `0` to `9`.

You can `Mod + H` and then press `0` to `9` to re-open recent note just using the keyboard.

To open in new tab: hold `Mod` key when clicking.

## Syntax highlighting of blocks

Blocks are syntax highlighted based on their type.

## Formatting of blocks

You can format current block using:

- `Alt + Shift + F` keyboard shortcut
- right-click and use context menu `Block / Format as ${type}`
- press format icon in status bar (bottom right)

We support formatting of Go, JSON, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Markdown blocks.

# Multiple notes

## Open another note

- `Mod + K` for note switcher
- click on note to open

or:

- enter text to narrow down list of notes
- `up` / `down` arrow keys to select a note
- `Enter` to open selected note

## Create a new note

- `Mod + K` to open note switcher
- type name of the note to create
- `Enter` to create if the name doesn't match any existing note
- `Mod + Enter` to create if the name partially matches an existing note

Or: context menu: `Create New note`.

## Create a new scratch note

`Alt + N` to create temporary scratch note. We'll pick a unique name `scratch-<n>`

## Archive and unarchive note

To keep the note but put it aside, archive it.

Context menu: `This note` / `Archive`.

Command `Archive note` in command palette (`Mod + Shift + K`).

Open note selector with `Mod + K`, click archive icon:

![Archive in note selector](/help-note-selector-archive.png)

To open archive note, click `show archived` link in note selector:

![Show archived](/help-show-archived.png)

Archived notes show at the top. You can unarchive with an icon or open the note and use context menu `This note` / `Un-archive` or `Un-archive note` command.

## Delete a note

Context menu: `This Note / Delete` or:

- `Mod + K` for note switcher
- select a note with arrow key or by typing a partial name match
- `Mod + Delete` or `Mod + Backspace` to delete selected note

A `scratch` note cannot be deleted.

## Rename a note

Context menu: `This Note / Rename`

# Default notes

At first run we create 3 default notes:

- `scratch`, `Alt + 1`
- `daily journal`, `Alt + 2`
- `inbox`, `Alt + 3`

You can delete them (except the `scratch` note).

`scratch` note is meant for temporary notes.

`inbox` for storing things to process later e.g. links to YouTube videos to watch later or web pages to read later.

`daily journal` is for daily notes. We auto-create a block for each day.
∞∞∞markdown
# Search and replace

Press `Mod + F` for search UI:

![Search in note](/help-find.png)

We support:
- match case
- match whole word
- regular expression

∞∞∞markdown
# Search across notes

To invoke full-text search in notes:
- `Mod + Shift + F`
- `Find in notes` in Command Palette (Mod + Shift + K)

![Search in notes](/help-notes-search.png)

The search algorightm is:
- if you search for `foo,` it'll find all lines that have `foo`
- if you search for `foo bar`, it'll find all lines that have `foo` **AND** `bar`
- if you want exact search: `"foo bar"`
∞∞∞markdown
# Ask AI

We provide a basic functionality for asking.

It's optimized for the following workflow:
- type your question in a block
- invoke `Ask AI` interface
- pick which AI model you'll send your query
- send the query to AI
- optionally insert the response as a new block

Use context menu `Ask AI` or `Ask AI` command in command palette (`Mod + Shift + K`).

We open AI chat interface pre-populated with the content of selection or current block.

![Ask AI](/help-ask-ai.png)

You can edit your question and press `Ask AI` button to send the question and receive the response.

Once you receive the response, you can insert it as new block.

![Ask AI Response](/help-ask-ai-response.png)

We support a lot of AI models. You can pick the model using selector in upper right corner.

![Ask AI models](/help-ask-ai-pick-model.png)

We don't charge for AI but AI providers do.

You need to provide your own API key. 

![Ask AI enter key](/help-ask-ai-api-key.png)

We support:
- [OpenAI](openai.com) for ChatGPT etc.
- [xAI](https://x.ai/) for Grok
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) for all models (including OpenAI / xAI models)

If you don't have API key, you need to get one. We recommend creating a unique api key for Edna.

Different models have different prices charged by API providers (not us).

The charge per usage. There's a fee for the size of your question (input tokens) and size of the response (output tokens).

Token is pretty much a word so think "number of words in the question or response".

We show the prices per million input tokens and million output tokens on the right side of the model selector.

## Free models

Some OpenRouter models are free. They show 0 for the price. You can also type **free** in model selector to see free models.

![Ask AI free models](/help-ask-ai-free-models.png)

You still need an OpenRouter API key to use free models.

## Getting OpenAI API key

Go to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

## Getting xAI (Grok) API Key

Go to [xAI](https://console.x.ai/), click `API Keys` section in left sidebar

## Getting OpenRouter API Key

Go to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys).

OpenRouter supports lots of models for lots of providers.

# Storing notes on disk

By default notes are stored in the browser (localStorage).

If your browser supports file system access (currently Chrome and Edge) you can store notes on disk.

You can do one time export from localStorage to a directory on disk:

- context menu: `Notes storage / Move notes from browser to directory`
- pick a directory on disk
- we save notes on disk as `${name}.edna.txt` files in chosen directory and delete notes in localStorage

You can have multiple directories with notes. Think of each directory with notes as a separate Workspace.

Use context menu `Notes storage / Switch to notes in directory` to switch to notes in a different directory. If it's an empty directory, without existing notes, we'll create default `scratch` note.

You can go back to storing notes in the browser with context menu `Notes storage / Switch to browser (localStorage)`. Unlike going from browser => directory, it doesn't import the notes from directory.
∞∞∞markdown
# Accessing notes on multiple computers

If you pick a directory managed by Dropbox or One Drive or Google Drive etc. then you'll be able to access notes on multiple computers.

On the first computer export notes from browser to disk:

- context menu: `Notes storage / Move notes from browser to directory`
- pick a directory shared by Dropbox / One Drive / Google Drive etc.

On other computers:

- context menu: `Notes storage / Switch to notes in directory`
- pick the same directory

Please note that that the last written version wins. If you switch really quickly between computers, before the directory with notes has been replicated, you might over-write previous content.
∞∞∞markdown
# Encryption

When storing notes on disk, you can encrypt them with a password.

The password is only stored in your browser (in local storage). It never leaves your computer.

Encryption and decryption takes place on your computer.

If you lose the password, you'll lose access to your notes.

**Don't lose the password**.

Notes are encrypted with [ChaCha20-Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305) algorithm via [kiss-crypto](https://github.com/team-reflect/kiss-crypto) library.

## Picking good password

Good password is:

- long (short passwords can be cracked via brute force; long passwords cannot)
- easy to type
- easy to remember

We recommend passwords that are long, memorable phrases.

Example: `Blue bear attacked a tiny dog`.

Such passwords are easier to type and remember than typical "8a$7y!glo" passwords.
∞∞∞markdown
# Running code

## Run code blocks

If current block is Go or JavaScript block, you can run it:

- `Mod + E` keyboard shortcut (`Smart Run`)
- context menu: `Run` / `Run <language> block` or [`Smart Run`](#smart-run)
- command palette: `Block: Run <language> block`
- `Run` button in status bar (bottom right)

The output of execution will be shown in a new block created below the executed block.

For Go:

- code block must be a valid, complete Go program with `main` function
- we capture and show stdout and sterr output
- we have the same execution capability as https://tools.arslexis.io/goplayground/

A starting point:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
}
```

For JavaScript:

- code is executed in the browser with `eval()`
- the output is the value of last expression
- don't run untrusted code

Examples of JavaScript code and its output.

```javascript
"foo";
```

Last expression is string `"foo"` so the output will be `foo`.

---

```javascript
let a = [1, 2, 3];
```

There is no last expression so the output will be `undefined`

---

```javascript
let a = [1, 2, 3];
a;
```

Last expression is an array `a` so output is `1,2,3`.

---

```javascript
let a = [1, 2, 3];
JSON.stringify(a);
```

Last expression is an array formatted as json so output is `[1,2,3]`.

---

We also capture `console.log()`, `console.warn()`, `console.debug()`, `console.error()` calls.

```javascript
console.log("hello");
```

Output is:

```
undefined
console output:
hello
```

- `undefined` because there was no last expression
- `console output:` to indicate those are capture console.log calls
- `hello` from console.log calls in your code

---

```javascript
async function main() {
  return "foo";
}
main();
```

The last expression is return value of `main()` function, so output is `foo`.

We handle async functions.

## Run JavaScript functions over content

You can run JavaScript functions with the content of a current block or a selection.

The function gets the content as argument, can traform it, and we show the output in a block below.

For example a function can sort the lines in a block, calculate md5 hash or transform it to upper case. The possibilities are literally limitless.

To run a JavasScript function with content of block:

- context menu: `Run` / `Run function with block content`
- command palette: `Run function with block content`
- pick a function from the list

To run a JavasScript function with selection:

- context menu: `Run` / `Run function with selection`
- command palette: `Run function with selection`
- pick a function from the list

If you want to see all built-in functions use:

- context menu: `Run`, `Show built-in functions`
- command palette: `Shw built-in functions`

You can see what built-in functions are available, how they are implemented and use them as an example of how to write your own functions.

This functionality is inspired by https://boop.okat.best/ so our built-in functions come from Boop.

## Write your own functions

You can write custom JavaScript functions that operate on text (content of the block or a selection), transform it in some way to create an output block.

For example you can write a function that sorts lines of text.

To write custom functions create a special `edna: my functions` note:

- context menu: `Run`, `Create your own functions`
- command palette: `Create your own functions`

Each JavaScript block is a function.

The code must be implemented as `function main(input) { ... your code }`.

We use the same format as https://boop.okat.best/.

`input` is an object:

```json
{
  text: string,
  fullText: string,
  postInfo: (message: string) => void,
  postError: (message: string) => void,
}
```

To return value you assign it to `input.text` and `input.fullText`. `postInfo()` and `postError()` functions show a notification message.

We show `input.text` or `input.fullText` as output block if, after execution, it differs from the original value.

Why `text` and `fullText`? I have no idea, I just copied [Boop](https://boop.okat.best/) and that's how their API works.

In my implementation `text` and `fullText` are the same.

You also need to provide metadata at the top in the format:

```
/**
{
  "api":1,
  "name":"Add Slashes",
  "description":"Escapes your text.",
  "author":"Ivan",
  "icon":"quote",
  "tags":"add,slashes,escape"
}
**/
```

Don't get cute and reformat it any way or change `/**` and `**/` to something else. Best to copy it and change values.

Currently the important fields are `name`, and `description` because they are shown in function selection dialog.

In future I might add more `api` versions, but at the moment there's just 1.

Here's the simplest function that returns `foo` as a result:

```javascript
/**
{
  "api":1,
  "name":"Show foo",
  "description":"Returns string 'foo'",
  "author":"Chris",
  "icon":"quote",
  "tags":""
}
**/

async function main(input) {
  input.text = "foo";
}
```

As you can see, we support `async` functions.

### Using external libraries

You can use any JavaScript library available via https://esm.sh or https://www.jsdelivr.com/ (or similar).

Here's an example function that uses `camelCase` functio from `lodash` package imported from https://esm.sh

```javascript
async function main(input) {
  let lodash = (await import("https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21")).default;
  input.text = lodash.camelCase(input.text);
}
```

Debugging tip: sometimes module exports functions direct, sometimes as `default`.

To figure this out for a library, in browser's dev tools console do:

```
let m = (await import("https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21"))
```

then inspect the `m` object in console to see available functions.

## Share your JavaScript functions with others

Share your functions with other via https://github.com/kjk/edna/discussions/categories/share-javascript-functions

## Smart Run

`Mod + E` is a shortcut for smart run, which has the following logic:

- if there is selection, it does `Run functions with selection` command
- if current block is runnable (JavaScript or Go) it'll run the block as code (command `Block: Run <language> block`)
- otherwise it does `Run function with block content` command

Use `Alt + Shift + R` to force `Run function with block content` command.

# Exporting notes to a .zip file

Edna files are just text files with `.edna.txt` extension.

You can export all the notes to a .zip file.

Context menu: `Export notes to zip file` menu.

We pack all the notes into a .zip file and initiate auto-download as `edna.notes.export-YYYY-MM-DD.zip` file to browser's downloads directory.

You can then e.g. restore the notes by unzipping it to a directory and opening that directory in Edna with `Notes storage` / `Switch to notes in a directory` context menu.

# Lists with TODO items

In Markdown blocks, lists with [x] and [ ] are rendered as checkboxes:

- [ ] Try out Edna
- [ ] Do laundry
∞∞∞math
This is a Math block. Lines are evaluated as math expressions.

radius = 5
area = radius^2 \* PI
sqrt(9)

It also supports some basic unit conversions, including currencies:

13 inches in cm
time = 3900 seconds to minutes
time \* 2

1 EUR in USD

// code blocks
// Edna is great for storing code snippets
// this is a javascript block
// change type of block with `Mod + L`

# Privacy and security

Your notes are private and secure.

Notes are stored on your computer: in the browser (local storage) or on disk.

For additional security, you can [encrypt notes](#encryption) with a password.

The code is [open source](https://github.com/kjk/edna) so you can audit it.
∞∞∞markdown
# No lock in

The notes are stored in plain text files on disk (or in localStorage under `note:${name}` key)

Blocks are marked with `\n∞∞∞${type}\n` e.g. `\n∞∞∞markdown\n` marks the beginning of markdown block.

You can edit the notes in any text editor (just be mindful of the above block markers).

You can back them up, store in git repositories, write scripts to process them.

They are not locked in a proprietary Edna format.

# Credits

Edna is a fork of [Heynote](https://github.com/heyman/heynote) with the following differences:

- web first (no desktop apps)
- multiple notes
- ability to access notes on multiple devices by storing them on folder managed by Dropbox / One Drive / Google Drive

There's a spirit of Notational Velocity and Simplenote in Edna in how it allows quickly creating notes and switching between them.

Edna is built on [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/), [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/), [Math.js](https://mathjs.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
